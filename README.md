👋 Hi, I’m @YapChanChen, an independent AI collaborator and systems thinker.  
👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence alignment, AI-human collaboration, and philosophy of cognition.  
🌱 I’m currently exploring large language model behaviors through human-AI interaction testing and theory construction.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on experimental AI-human alignment projects and ethical interface design.
